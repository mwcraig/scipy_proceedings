A Numerical Perspective to Terraforming a Desert
------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   The VPython package was originally developed for use in introductory physics classes by users with little or no programming experience. It displays three dimensional objects like spheres, boxes and arrows simply by creating an instance of one of those objects. Changing the displayed property of an object, like its position, color, or size, is done by changing the corresponding attributes on the Python object. This approach makes it relatively easy for novice programmers to visualize the motion of objects. Display is done in the user’s web browser by passing messages from Python to the javascript library glowscript, which renders the scene using WebGL. VPython also works in classic Jupyter notebooks and in Jupyter lab, displaying the scene in the output of a cell, and in IDEs like spyder. We also describe a cloud-hosted version at glowscript.org; in this case Python code is transpiled to javascript and then displayed in the browser. Documentation and examples are available at vpython.org.

.. figure:: figure1.png

   This is the caption.:code:`chunk of code` inside of it. :label:`egfig`

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :align: center
   :figclass: w

   This is a wide figure, specified by adding "w" to the figclass.  It is also
   center aligned, by setting the align keyword (can be left, right or center).
   This caption also has :code:`chunk of code`.

.. figure:: figure1.png
   :scale: 20%
   :figclass: bht

   This is the caption on a smaller figure that will be placed by default at the
   bottom of the page, and failing that it will be placed inline or at the top.
   Note that for now, scale is relative to a completely arbitrary original
   reference size which might be the original size of your image - you probably
   have to play with it.  :label:`egfig2`

As you can see in Figures :ref:`egfig` and :ref:`egfig2`, this is how you reference

.. table:: This is the caption for the materials table. :label:`mtable`

   +------------+----------------+
   | Material   | Units          |
   +============+================+
   | Stone      | 3              |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Water      | 12             |
   +------------+----------------+
   | Cement     | :math:`\alpha` |
   +------------+----------------+


We show the different quantities of materials required in Table
:ref:`mtable`.


.. The statement below shows how to adjust the width of a table.

.. raw:: latex

   \setlength{\tablewidth}{0.8\linewidth}


.. table:: This is the caption for the wide table.
   :class: w

   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+
   | This   | is |  a   | very | very | wide | table  |
   +--------+----+------+------+------+------+--------+

Unfortunately, restructuredtext can be picky about tables, so if it simply
won't work try raw LaTeX:


.. raw:: latex

   \begin{table*}

     \begin{longtable*}{|l|r|r|r|}
     \hline
     \multirow{2}{*}{Projection} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Area in square miles}\tabularnewline
     \cline{2-4}
      & Large Horizontal Area & Large Vertical Area & Smaller Square Area\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Albers Equal Area  & 7,498.7 & 10,847.3 & 35.8\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Web Mercator & 13,410.0 & 18,271.4 & 63.0\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Difference & 5,911.3 & 7,424.1 & 27.2\tabularnewline
     \hline
     Percent Difference & 44\% & 41\% & 43\%\tabularnewline
     \hline
     \end{longtable*}

     \caption{Area Comparisons \DUrole{label}{quanitities-table}}

   \end{table*}

Perhaps we want to end off with a quote by Lao Tse [#]_:

  *Muddy water, let stand, becomes clear.*
